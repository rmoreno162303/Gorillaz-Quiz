# Gorillaz Quiz

##challengefourroberto

### Project Description
Attached you will find the link to the Gorillaz quiz you requested. When you start the quiz, a timer starts and you are presented with a question. When you answer a question, you are presented with a series of questions until the game is over and you are prompted to save your initials. I need to finalize code to save score to highscore page.
